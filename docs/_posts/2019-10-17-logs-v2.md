## 1. Introduction

Hello there,

This week I've continue working with the logs from the previous week, integrating it in my test Webserver:

## 2. Logs V2

The structure of the log file is:

- "New Simulation ==> " + str(datetime.now().strftime("%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S")) + ": " + user.username + " " + client_ip + " " + simulation_type + " " + exercise_id + " " + host.ip + " " + container.id + "\n"

- "Error ==> 500 Internal Server Error" + "\n"

I've saved the data of the file in a python dictionary to convert it into a Graph, like in the previous week I've been able to load it on a Django view, but so far no success loading multiple graphs, the Web page has some dynamism as it takes parameters from the URL to filter by USERS
